# Challenge 09

## Professional README Generator

In this challenge I have created a professional README.md generator that will prompt the user some questions that will then create a README.md file. As the user inputs data we generate that information. For license, we grab the selection from the list and then we generate a badge, a link and a description of the license.

**Note**: For the purpose of the gif I have the file path set to ./assets/README.md.

The screen recording shows all the prompts and how to initialize the program. To shorten video length i prefilled the data and started screen recording from the last point.

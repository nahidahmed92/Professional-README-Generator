# Professional README Generator

  ![MIT Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

  ## Description

  I was motivated to make this professional README generator to help me save time when creating projects so I can put my time to focus on my projects. I built this project to free up more time to focus on my projects. It solves issues where a user might forget something to add in their README. I learned about licenses and badges, as well as how to write files.
